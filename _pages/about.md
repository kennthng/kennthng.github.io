I am an assitant professor in mathematics and actuarial science at the Ohio State University. I received my PhD degree at the University of Illinois under the supervision of Dr. Alfred Chong (Heriot-Watt) and Prof. Phillip Yam (CUHK). My research interests encompass stochastic control, specifically in forward utilities and mean field games, with their financial and actuarial applications. I am also an associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA).
